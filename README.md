# My Token

This project aims to develop a simple token contract. It provides minting and burning features and also these features are only accessible by the owner(Here owner is the address of the person who deploys the contract and it cannot be changed) of the contract.

## Getting started

To test this contract you can either just copy and paste it in remix ide or test it locally in your code editors or ides.

### Set-Up Locally

To set it up locally start by clonning the repo

git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Thakur-geek/My_Token_Contract.git

now for compilling the contract use solc.js and to install solc use

```sh
yarn add solc
```

once compiled use ethers.js to deploy the contract and for installing ethers.js use

```sh
